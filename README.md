<h1>A Simple HTTP Server in Scala</h1>
<p>
This is a simple experiment just for fun (if you like those kinda things) and
to learn a bit of <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a>. It is a simple
HTTP web server that reply to GET request. It has been written from scratch
without any use of external libraries, only with java standard library and 
scala library.
